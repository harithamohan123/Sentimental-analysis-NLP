NLU : Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is focused on enabling machines to understand and process natural language such as human speech. NLU involves analyzing the structure, meaning, and context of natural language data, such as written text and spoken dialogue.
                                                                                                                                                   
NLG : Natural language generation (NLG) is a subfield of natural language processing (NLP) which focuses on the production of natural language content generated from structured data. It uses algorithms and techniques such as natural language processing, text-to-speech, and machine learning to generate natural-sounding and meaningful content.

 -- Tokenization: the process of breaking down a piece of text into individual words, sentences, or other meaningful elements.            
 -- Stemming: the process of reducing a word to its base form, such as reducing ‘admits’ to ‘admit’.                          
 -- Lemmatization: the process of reducing a word to its dictionary form, such as reducing ‘admits’ to ‘admit’.                                       
 -- Named Entitiy Recognition :  NER is used to identify and classify named entities such as people, locations, organizations, and products.           
 -- Parts of Speech : the process of Identifing words as noun,verb,adj,etc....                                               
 --chunking : takes the identified entities and groups them into meaningful chunks of text, such as noun phrases.                                         
                                                                                                                                                
 NLP tool kit : Providing a Natural Language Processing (NLP) toolkit for feature extraction in text is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of linguistics and machine learning.
